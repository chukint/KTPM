Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
document, but changing it is not allowed.
Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share 
and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to 
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the 
software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to 
most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose 
authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is 
covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to 
your programs, too.
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our 
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to 
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), 
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change 
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you 
can do these things.
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny 
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions 
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the 
software, or if you modify it.
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for 
a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must 
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must 
show them these terms so they know their rights.
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) 
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute 
and/or modify the software.
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the 
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to 
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced 
by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We 
wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.
To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for 
everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification 
follow.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice 
placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of 
this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to any such program 
or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any 
derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the 
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or 
translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included 
without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as 
"you".
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by 
this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is 
not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents 
constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by 
running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as 
you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and 
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and 
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License 
and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the 
Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may 
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus 
forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications 
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of 
these conditions:
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating 
that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or 
in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be 
licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this 
License.
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, 
you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most 
ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate 
copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that 
you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these 
conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.  
(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print 
such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print 
an announcement.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable 
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably 
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and 
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate 
works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a 
work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms 
of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your 
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the 
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on 
the Program.
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the 
Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or 
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this 
License.
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 
2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a 
medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to 
give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically 
performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the 
corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 
2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only for 
noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code 
or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all 
the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface 
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation 
of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code 
distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either 
source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) 
of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component 
itself accompanies the executable.
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy 
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source 
code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though 
third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as 
expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, 
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate 
your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or 
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so 
long as such parties remain in full compliance.
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. 
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program 
or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not 
accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or 
any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to 
do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying 
the Program or works based on it.
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), 
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to 
copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. 
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the 
rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by 
third parties to this License.
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions 
are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that 
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the 
conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy 
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent 
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution 
of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through 
you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to 
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and 
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or 
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this 
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software 
distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many 
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software 
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that 
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to 
distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that 
choice.
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a 
consequence of the rest of this License.
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit 
geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that 
distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In 
such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body 
of this License.
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the 
General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in 
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems 
or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later 
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of 
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may
choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for 
permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, 
write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. 
Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of 
all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of 
software generally.
NO WARRANTY
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR 
THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE 
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE 
PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, 
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL 
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE 
PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY 
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR 
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA 
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A 
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER 
OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible 
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software 
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach 
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion 
of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a 
pointer to where the full notice is found.
    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it 
under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free 
Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any 
later version.
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT 
ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS 
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details.
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along 
with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 
Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it 
starts in an interactive mode:
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes 
with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.  This is free software, 
and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type 'show c' 
for details.
The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate 
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be 
called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be 
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, 
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.  Here 
is a sample; alter the names:
    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program 
'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
    signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
    Ty Coon, President of Vice
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into 
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may 
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the 
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public 
License instead of this License.
"CLASSPATH" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL
Certain source files distributed by Oracle America and/or its affiliates are 
subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but 
only where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's header 
the words "Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the "Classpath" 
exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code."
    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making 
a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of the 
GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.
    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you 
permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an 
executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and 
to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice, 
provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and 
conditions of the license of that module.  An independent module is a module 
which is not derived from or based on this library.  If you modify this 
library, you may extend this exception to your version of the library, but you 
are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception 
statement from your version.
