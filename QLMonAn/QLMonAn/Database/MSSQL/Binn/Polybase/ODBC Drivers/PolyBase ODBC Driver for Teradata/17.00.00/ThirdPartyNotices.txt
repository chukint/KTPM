The following is the license for terasso, which is included in this package.

--License Start--
Copyright © 2000 - 2018 Teradata Corporation


IMPORTANT - READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE 
SOFTWARE. TERADATA WILL LICENSE THE SOFTWARE TO YOU ONLY IF YOU ACCEPT THE 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND MEET THE CONDITIONS FOR USING THE 
SOFTWARE DESCRIBED BELOW. BY USING THE SOFTWARE YOU (1) AGREE 
TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND (2) REPRESENT AND WARRANT 
THAT YOU POSSESS THE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF YOU, 
YOUR EMPLOYER (WHEN ACTING ON BEHALF OF YOUR EMPLOYER), AND/OR A 
TERADATA-AUTHORIZED LICENSEE (WHEN YOU AND YOUR EMPLOYER ARE ACTING ON BEHALF 
OF A TERADATA-AUTHORIZED LICENSEE). IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE TERMS AND 
CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE. 

This License Agreement (“Agreement”) is a legal contract between you (as 
defined below) and Teradata (as defined below) regarding the Software (as 
defined below). The terms “you”, “your” and “yours” collectively 
and individually refer to you as an individual and to any company for which 
you are acting. The term “Teradata” refers to either Teradata U.S., Inc. 
for Software deliveries in the US or Teradata Ireland Ltd. for Software 
deliveries outside the United States. “Software” refers to the software 
product identified above, which consists of computer software code in object 
code form only, as well as associated documentation that Teradata may elect in 
its sole discretion to provide you. “Software” also includes any and all 
error corrections, bug fixes, updates, upgrades, or new versions or releases 
of the Software (collectively and individually, “Enhancements”) that 
Teradata may elect in its sole discretion to provide you. 

“Scenario (i)”: If you are using the Software on behalf of a 
Teradata-authorized licensee that has already purchased a license to the 
Software pursuant to an executed master agreement (“Master Agreement”) 
with Teradata or one of its affiliates, the terms of such master agreement 
prevail over this Agreement except for Section 2.a.(i).  

“Scenario (ii)”: If Scenario (i) does not apply to you, then this 
Agreement constitutes the entire understanding of 
the parties with respect to the Software and Services, and supersedes all other 
prior agreements and understandings whether oral or written. For clarity, 
Section 2.a.(i) does not apply to you. For example, individuals that have 
downloaded a copy of the Teradata Express version of the Teradata Relational 
Database product fall within Scenario (ii). 

   1. Term. This Agreement commences on the earliest date of the first  
      installation or first use of the 
      Software (the “Effective Date”). Unless terminated earlier as 
      provided herein, this agreement, including your license to the Software, 
      will expire or terminate on the same date that your Teradata-authorized 
      license to use the Teradata Relational Database product expires or 
      terminates (whichever occurs first). 

   2. License.  
   
      (a) Teradata grants you a nonexclusive, nontransferable, paid up 
          license: 

         (i) If Scenario (i) applies - subject to your compliance with all 
             of the terms and conditions of the Master Agreement, to install 
             and use the Software on any number and type of 
             computers in object code form for your internal use solely for the 
             purpose of facilitating your Teradata-authorized license to use 
             the Teradata Relational Database product.  

         (ii) If Scenario (ii) applies - subject to your compliance with 
             all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, to install and 
             use the Software on your computer workstation in object code form 
             for your internal use solely for purposes of facilitating your 
             Teradata-authorized license to use the Teradata Relational 
             Database product. You may make reasonable archival backup copies 
             of the Software, but may only use an archival copy in lieu of your 
             primary copy and subject to the same restrictions as your primary 
             copy. 

      (b) The term Third Party Software means computer programs or modules 
          (including their documentation) that bear the logo, copyright and/or 
          trademark of a third party (including open source software that are 
          contained in files marked as “open source” or the like) or are otherwise 
          subject to the written license terms of a third party.  The term “Software” 
          does not include Third Party Software. Third Party Software is licensed to you 
          subject to the applicable license terms accompanying it, included 
          in/with it, referenced in it, or otherwise entered into by you with 
          respect to it. Third Party Software license terms include those found 
          in the FOSS licensing zip file accompanying the Software. Teradata 
          provides source code to certain Third Party Software for certain 
          periods of time in compliance with certain applicable licenses. To 
          request such source code, visit 
          http://developer.teradata.com/download/license/oss-request. 

      (c) You will not sell, copy, rent, loan, modify, transfer, disclose, 
          embed, sublicense, create derivative works of or distribute the 
          Software, in whole or in part, without Teradata’s prior written 
          consent. You are granted no rights to obtain or use the Software’s 
          source code. You will not reverse-assemble, reverse compile or 
          reverse-engineer the Software, except as expressly permitted by 
          applicable law without the possibility of contractual waiver. 
          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, you do not have any 
          license, right, or authority to subject the Software, in whole or in 
          part or as part of a larger work, to any terms of any other 
          agreement, including GNU Public Licenses. 

      (d) No license rights to the Software will be implied. The Software, 
          which includes all copies thereof (whether in whole or in part), is 
          and remains the exclusive property of Teradata. You 
          will ensure that all copies of the Software contain Teradata's 
          copyright notices, as well as all other proprietary 
          legends. Teradata reserves the right to inspect your use of the 
          Software for purposes of verifying your compliance with the terms and 
          conditions of this Agreement. 

   3. Responsibilities. You are responsible for the installation of the 
      Software, as well as for providing data security and backup operations. 
      This Agreement does not require Teradata to provide you with any 
      Enhancements, consulting services, technical assistance, installation, 
      training, support, or maintenance of any kind (collectively and 
      individually, “Services”). To the extent that Teradata elects to 
      provide you with any Services, such Services are provided to you at 
      Teradata’s sole discretion and may be modified or discontinued at any 
      time for any reason. 

   4. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. TERADATA: (a) PROVIDES 
      SERVICES (IF ANY), (b) LICENSES THE SOFTWARE, AND (c) PROVIDES THIRD 
      PARTY SOFTWARE TO YOU ON AN “AS-IS” BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY 
      KIND (ORAL OR WRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY). WITHOUT 
      LIMITATION TO THE FOREGOING, THERE ARE NO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
      MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. 
      TERADATA DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE, THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, OR 
      SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR CONFORM TO ANY SPECIFICATIONS, 
      OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE OR THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE WILL BE 
      UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE. YOU BEAR THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SATISFACTORY 
      QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY, AND RESULTS OBTAINED FROM THE SOFTWARE, 
      THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, AND SERVICES. 

      SOME JURISDICTIONS RESTRICT DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTY, SO THE ABOVE 
      DISCLAIMERS MAY NOT FULLY APPLY TO YOU. 

   5. LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY: UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL TERADATA’S 
      AND ITS LICENSORS’ TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS RELATING TO 
      THIS AGREEMENT, THE SERVICES, THE SOFTWARE, AND/OR THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE 
      (WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, STATUTE, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR 
      OTHERWISE) EXCEED US$1,000; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE FOREGOING WILL 
      NOT APPLY TO CLAIMS FOR (A) PERSONAL INJURY, INCLUDING DEATH, TO THE 
      EXTENT CAUSED BY TERADATA'S NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT; OR (B) 
      PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO TANGIBLE REAL OR PERSONAL PROPERTY TO THE EXTENT 
      CAUSED BY TERADATA'S NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT EQUAL TO THE 
      AMOUNT OF DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO ONE MILLION DOLLARS PER OCCURRENCE. IN NO 
      EVENT WILL TERADATA OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, 
      SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR FOR LOSS OF 
      PROFITS, REVENUE, TIME, OPPORTUNITY OR DATA, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE 
      POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 

      SOME JURISDICTIONS RESTRICT LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY, SO THE ABOVE 
      LIMITATIONS MAY NOT FULLY APPLY TO YOU. 

   6. Government Restrictions. You agree that you will not, directly or 
      indirectly, export or transmit any Software without obtaining 
      Teradata’s prior written authorization, as well as appropriate 
      governmental approvals, including those required by the U.S. Government. 
      Use and or distribution of this software is subject to export laws and 
      regulations of the United States and other jurisdictions. The links 
      below connect you to applicable U.S. government agencies, and their 
      regulations, that have jurisdiction over this transaction. 

      http://www.bis.doc.gov/
      http://www.treas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/

      In using this product, you acknowledge that this transaction is 
      subject to applicable export control laws and you certify that your download, 
      use and/or subsequent distribution of this product is not prohibited under 
      applicable laws and regulations. 

      The Government’s use, duplication, or disclosure of Teradata’s commercial computer 
      software and commercial computer software documentation is subject to: (a) the 
      Restricted Rights Notice set forth in 48 C.F.R. ¶ 52.227-14 (Rights In Data - General); 
      (b) Teradata’s standard commercial license rights supplemented by 48 C.F.R. ¶ 52.227-19
      (Commercial Computer Software - Restricted Rights); and/or (c) the limited rights and 
      license set forth 48 CFR ¶ 252.227-7015 (Technical Data–Commercial Items), as applicable. 

   7. Termination and Expiration. A party may terminate this Agreement with 
      or without cause, upon providing written notice to the other parties. 
      When this Agreement terminates or expires, you will immediately cease 
      all use of the Software, permanently remove the Software from all 
      computers, destroy all copies of the Software, and (upon receipt of 
      Teradata’s request) provide a signed written certification that the 
      foregoing has occurred. Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 will 
      survive expiration or termination of this Agreement. 

   8. Choice of Law and Dispute Resolution. The parties will attempt in 
      good faith to resolve any controversy or claim by negotiation or 
      mediation. If they are unable to do so, and regardless of the causes of 
      action alleged and whether they arise under this Agreement or otherwise, 
      the claim will be resolved by arbitration before a sole arbitrator in 
      Dayton, Ohio pursuant to the then-current Commercial Rules of the 
      American Arbitration Association and the federal substantive and 
      procedural law of arbitration. The arbitrator’s award will be final 
      and binding, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction 
      thereof, but may include only damages consistent with the limitations in 
      this Agreement. Each party will bear its own attorney's fees and costs 
      related to the arbitration. The obligations to negotiate, mediate and 
      arbitrate shall not apply to claims for misuse or infringement of a 
      party’s intellectual property rights. Any claim or action must be 
      brought within two years after the claimant knows or should have known of 
      the claim. New York law will govern the interpretation and enforcement of 
      this Agreement, except that the Federal Arbitration Act will govern the 
      interpretation and enforcement of the arbitrability of claims under this 
      Section. 

   9. Feedback. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary: (a) Teradata will 
      have no obligation of any kind with respect to any Software-related 
      comments, suggestions, design changes or improvements that you elect to 
      provide to Teradata in either verbal or written form (collectively, 
      “Software Feedback”), and (b) Teradata and its affiliates are hereby 
      free to use any ideas, concepts, know-how or techniques, in whole or in 
      part, contained in Software Feedback: (i) for any purpose whatsoever, 
      including developing, manufacturing, and/or marketing products and/or 
      services incorporating Software Feedback in whole or in part, and (ii) 
      without any restrictions or limitations, including requiring the payment 
      of any license fees, royalties, or other consideration. 

  10. Confidentiality. You will not disclose the results of any testing or 
      evaluations, including any benchmarks, insofar as it relates to the 
      Software without Teradata’s prior written consent. 

  11. Miscellaneous. In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and 
      the General Terms of Use, this Agreement will prevail with respect to 
      the subject matter hereof. No oral representation or change to this 
      Agreement will be binding upon either party unless agreed to in writing 
      and signed by authorized representatives of all parties. You will not 
      assign this Agreement or your rights, nor will you delegate your 
      obligations under this Agreement. Failure by either party to enforce any 
      term or condition of this Agreement will not be deemed a waiver of 
      future enforcement of that or any other term or condition. The 
      provisions of this Agreement are severable. "Include", "includes", and 
      "including" shall be interpreted as introducing a list of examples which 
      do not limit the generality of any preceding words or any words in the 
      list of examples.
